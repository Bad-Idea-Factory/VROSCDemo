# VROSCDemo
OSC Interfaces in Unreal Engine
Currently just a simple demo with a UMG to control Resolume. 
OSC addresses are stored in an array, the UMG elements reference an index in that array when calling the send osc event
You can easily add more UMG widgets and more OSC addresses to that array.
